                <p>I am a senior at the University of Maryland majoring in journalism and minoring in sociology. I work for Capital News Service as a student reporter in Annapolis MD, covering the legislatures environment and Board of Public Works. I love to play volleyball and working out in the gym for some physical activity. On other occasions I like too spend my time reading, cooking, baking and crochetting. Being in the major of journalism, it has taught me a lot about the world; the good the bad and the ugly. I am more informed on topics that I never woould consider before like government and business. I am excited for where this degree will take me. </p>
