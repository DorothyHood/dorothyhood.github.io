                        <p>From blue crabs to boating, the Chesapeake Bay is an East Coast necessity. The bay creates
                            jobs,
                            provides food and is a great place to have fun.</p>

                        <p>The Chesapeake Bay, according to the Maryland State Archives, is the largest estuary in the
                            United States and the third largest in the world. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                            Administration defines an estuary as bodies of water that are usually home to “unique plant
                            and
                            animal communities.”</p>

                        <p>The bay filters out into the Atlantic Ocean and its reservoirs spread to six different
                            states,
                            Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and the
                            District
                            of Columbia. Holding 18 trillion tons of water, only half of it comes from the ocean,
                            according
                            to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.</p>

                        <p> Maryland is known for its crabs, which are sourced directly from the bay. Not only are they
                            profitable food in Maryland, but also feed on “bottom-dwelling organisms,” according to the
                            Chesapeake Bay Program. There are about 227 million blue crabs in the Chesapeake Bay which
                            is a
                            19% decline from 282 in 2021, according to the data Winter Dredge survey.</p>

                        <p>“This impact was seen in 2005, as high Chesapeake temperatures caused a massive die-off of
                            the
                            seagrass,” said the NWF page on blue crabs.

                    <p>Why is it warm until November? Why are there not as many snowstorms? All of this is happening
                        because
                        of climate change. The United Nations defines climate change as the long-term shift in
                        temperatures
                        and weather patterns.</p>

                    <p>Greenhouse gases affect the Earth too, the main problem being carbon dioxide and methane,
                        according
                        to the U.N. Carbon dioxide comes from driving cars and heating houses.</p>

                    <p>“Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over
                        the
                        last 200 years,” according to the U.N.</p>

                    <p>As temperatures on Earth increase, the loss of habitat for the blue crabs gets smaller and
                        smaller.
                        The National Wildlife Federation said that warming temperatures in the bay are predicted to
                        impact
                        eelgrass, which is an essential habitat for juvenile blue crabs. According to the CBF,
                        “underwater
                        grass acreage in the Bay declined recently to about 60,000 acres.”</p>

                    <p>Maryland prides itself on their fishermen and the sourcing of crabs for locals and the rest of
                        the
                        U.S. to enjoy. Without the blue crabs, Maryland would lose millions of dollars that it relies on
                        from the sale of crabs. According to the Washingtonian’s report on the dwindling blue crab
                        population, after the pandemic, the dockside value of crabs decreased by more than $15 million.

                    </div>

                    <p>Greg Castan, the owner of a ProFish, a DC wholesale seafood company told Washingtonian that,
                        “prices are going to go up.” His company prides itself on sustainability, “we proactively seek
                        methods to conduct our business as responsible stewards for the environment.” </p>

                    <p>Overfishing and overconsumption could also play a part in the steady decline of crab populations
                        in the bay. In addition to the decline in populations, fishing hasn’t seemed to be impacted. The
                        more crabs cost, is more money in their pockets, according to an InsideClimate News article.
                    </p>

                    <p>The demand for crabs continues to stay steady creating more problems in the bay and fewer crabs
                        to go around.</p>
