        <h1>Early and Personal Life</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/SZA%2C_August_2013.jpg/1280px-SZA%2C_August_2013.jpg"
            alt="SZA">

        <p>Solána Imani Rowe was born in 1989 on November 8 in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in Maplewood, New
            Jersey. Her father was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother was an executive at AT&T. Rowe
            has an older half-sister, Tiffany Daniels, and an older brother, Daniel, aka Manhattan, a rapper.
            Her mother is Christian and her father is Muslim. She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow
            Islam.

            It's like the belief in one God, all the pillars of Islam et cetera, and I think those are ideas that will
            never leave me, those make sense in my spirit. It's the way that I connect with God; it has always made
            sense to me. I think I would love to wear my hijab but I feel like I don't wanna wear my hijab and talk
            crazy on stage and be in videos with Travis Scott. Like I don't wanna be disrespectful because I have too
            much love and respect for the religion, for my father, and for myself.
            She attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling.</p>

        <h1>Career</h1>
        <h2>2011-2014: Career Beginnings and EPs</h2>
        <p>SZA first met members of Top Dawg Entertainment during the CMJ New Music Report in 2011, when her boyfriend's
            clothing company sponsored a show in which Kendrick Lamar was performing. Her early music was given to TDE
            president Terrence "Punch" Henderson, who was surprised with the quality of the material. The two stayed
            in touch, and after SZA began generating buzz with the release of her two EPs, TDE stepped in to sign her in
            2013, making her the label's first female artist. SZA's early music was recorded with her friends and
            neighbors in which they "stole a bunch of beats off the Internet". On October 29, 2012, SZA
            self-released her debut EP See.SZA.Run.
        </p>

        <p>On April 10, 2013, SZA released her second EP, S, which was met with positive reviews from music
            critics. SZA promoted the extended play with the release of a music video for the song "Ice Moon",
            directed by Lemar & Dauley. On July 14, 2013, Top Dawg signed SZA. In October 2013, SZA went on a
            four show tour with Swedish band Little Dragon; starting on October 17 at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles
            and ending on October 24 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. In December 2013, SZA released the
            song "Teen Spirit" which was followed by the release of a remix featuring American rapper 50 Cent, along
            with a music video directed by APlusFilmz. In 2014, SZA featured on a variety of songs from her label-mates
            albums including two songs for Isaiah Rashad's debut EP Cilvia Demo as well as featuring on Schoolboy Q's
            debut studio album Oxymoron.</p>

        <p>On March 26, 2014, she released the single "Child's Play" featuring Chance the Rapper and produced by Dae One
            & XXYYXX. A studio EP, Z, was released on April 8, 2014; the lead single, "Babylon" was accompanied with a
            music video directed by APlusFilmz. To promote Z, SZA performed at several performance showcases at the
            SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas. SZA made her chart debut in the UK, where Z charted at number
            thirty-two on the R&B Charts, during the week ending April 19, 2014. Z debuted on the US Billboard 200 at
            number thirty nine, selling 6,980 copies in its opening week; the album also peaked at number nine on the
            Billboard Hip hop/R&B chart.</p>

        <h2>2015-2018: <i>Ctrl</i>and breakthrough</h2>
        <p>Whilst working on A, (now repackaged as her debut studio album and later retitled Ctrl), SZA began writing
            songs for other female artists including Beyoncé and Rihanna. Along with Rihanna and Tyran Donaldson, SZA
            co-wrote "Consideration" for Rihanna's album Anti (2016); besides writing, SZA also appeared on the track
            and later performed "Consideration" with Rihanna live at the 2016 Brit Awards on February 24, 2016</p>
        <p>In January 2017, SZA released "Drew Barrymore", the lead single from her upcoming album Ctrl. On April 28,
            2017, SZA signed her first major-label recording contract with RCA Records. On June 9, 2017, SZA released
            her debut album, Ctrl, to universal acclaim from music critics, scoring an 86 out of 100 rating on
            Metacritic. Ctrl debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, with 125,000 album-equivalent units, of
            which 80,000 were pure album sales; the album was supported by several singles, including "Love Galore",
            which peaked in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was later certified platinum. Ctrl was ranked
            as the best album of 2017 by Time.</p>
        <p>In August 2017, SZA collaborated with American pop rock band Maroon 5 on their single "What Lovers Do" from
            their sixth studio album Red Pill Blues. The single reached number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. This marked
            SZA's first top-ten hit as a featured artist on the Hot 100. The following month SZA released "Quicksand",
            which appeared on the soundtrack for HBO's Insecure, and, alongside Khalid and Post Malone, was featured on
            the remix version of Lorde's single "Homemade Dynamite", from her second studio album Melodrama. Also in
            2017, SZA worked on a joint album with Mark Ronson and Tame Impala.</p>

        <p>On November 28, 2017, SZA received five Grammy nominations including one for Best New Artist. She received
            the most nominations of any female artist for the 2018 Awards and was the fourth most nominated artist in
            total.[52] Despite this, she did not end up winning any of the awards she was nominated for.

            In January 2018, SZA featured with Kendrick Lamar on the track "All the Stars", which was released as the
            lead single to the soundtrack album of the film Black Panther. The single peaked at number 7 on the
            Billboard Hot 100, and this made SZA's second top-ten hit on the chart, after Maroon 5, "What Lovers Do"
            which peaked at number 9 on the chart. SZA collaborated with Cardi B on the track "I Do" for the album
            Invasion of Privacy.</p>
        <h2>2019-present: Collaboratioons and <i>SOS</i></h2>
        <p>In May 2019, SZA featured on DJ Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd, on the track "Just Us". A
            music video was later released for the song. On February 26, 2020, SZA and Justin Timberlake released "The
            Other Side", a song part of the Trolls World Tour soundtrack, alongside its music video. In March 2020, SZA
            signed with WME for representation in all areas. SZA performed, together with artists such as Bruce
            Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Halsey, a benefit concert for the state of New Jersey, in support of the state's
            work fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place on April 22, 2020, through at-home performances and the
            revenue will go to the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. On May 25, 2020, SZA showed interest on Twitter in
            releasing "a music dump" of previously unreleased material, potentially containing 20 songs.</p>

        <p>In August 2020, SZA tweeted and deleted, "At this point y'all gotta ask punch," referring to Terrence "Punch"
            Henderson, who is president of Top Dawg Entertainment. In another tweet, SZA indicated that "all [Punch]
            says to her" about releasing new music is "soon." This revealed that her relationship with her label owner
            Punch (Top Dawg Entertainment) has been hostile since the delays of her second album which was last
            announced back in an interview in 2019. SZA came back with her first release as a lead artist since 2017 on
            September 4, 2020, with "Hit Different", featuring Ty Dolla Sign, and production from The Neptunes. On
            December 25, 2020, SZA released "Good Days" on streaming platforms as a single after it originally debuted
            as a snippet in the outro of the "Hit Different" music video. English singer Jacob Collier provided
            background vocals for the single. The song hit its peak of number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it
            SZA's first top-ten single as a solo artist, despite SZA herself revealing that it was not initially planned
            to be a single. Both tracks were expected to appear on her then upcoming second studio album.</p>

    <p>On April 9, 2021, SZA was featured on the Doja Cat single "Kiss Me More". It became a number-one hit in New
        Zealand and reached the Top 40 in over a dozen countries, further having earned top-ten placements in the United
        States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Lithuania. The song also has a music video which
        premiered the same day as the single and was directed by Warren Fu.

        In late 2021, SZA's cover of "The Anonymous Ones" was released. It is a song written for the soundtrack of the
        2021 film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen. Her version of the song also plays during the closing credits of the
        film itself.

        A long-awaited collaboration from SZA with Summer Walker, "No Love" was finally released on November 5, 2021,
        after previously being teased back in late June via Walker's Instagram. After its success on the R&B charts, it
        later became an official single when the extended version was released in March the following year, along with a
        music video.</p>

    <p>On December 3, 2021, SZA released the song "I Hate U", after it went viral on TikTok; it was originally released
        exclusively on SoundCloud in August 2021. SZA confirmed after the 64th Annual Grammy Awards that she had
        finished her second album and is planning on releasing it "soon".

        On June 9, 2022, SZA released a deluxe version of her debut studio album Ctrl to commemorate its 5-year
        anniversary. It featured 7 previously unreleased songs, such as "2AM", "Jodie", "Percolator", and an alternative
        version of "Love Galore" without Travis Scott.

        On October 28, 2022, a new single called "Shirt" has been released, alongside its music video starring actor
        LaKeith Stanfield. The song was originally teased by SZA in late 2020 and after it gained popularity on TikTok
        because of a viral challenge, a snippet appeared as an outro at the end of the official music video of "Good
        Days". SZA teased another snippet of a song at the end of her new song's music video which she revealed to be
        called "Blind".</p>
    <p>On her 33rd birthday on November 8, 2022, SZA released a teaser titled "PSA" on her Instagram. The video ends
        with a morse code for "S.O.S.", sparking speculations about an upcoming project. On November 16, 2022, Billboard
        officially confirmed that her second studio album is titled SOS and was set for a December release date. On
        November 30, 2022, SZA posted the cover of her upcoming album SOS to her Instagram account. After performing
        "Shirt" and "Blind" on NBC's Saturday Night Live, SZA announced that the album would be released on December 9,
        2022. The album has so far spent its first five weeks atop the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the United States,
        becoming the first female R&B album of the 21st Century to achieve this feat.

        In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked SZA at number 180 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.</p>
