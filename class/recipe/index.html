    <p><b>Type of Dish: </b>Cookie, Dessert</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup nondairy butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nondairy milk, <i>at room temperature</i></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Icing Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cups confectiooners' sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup boiling water, <i>plus more if needed</i></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup nondairy semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 (18 x 12-inch) baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large
            bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, combine the sugar and butter and beat until creamy, about 5 minutes. Add the milk and
            vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in batches, beating after
            each addition, until combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough, 1/4 cup at a time, onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing the scoops 3 inches apart.
            Flatten them slightly with your hands (keep your hands wet to prevent the dough from sticking). Allow room
            between the scoops as the cookies will spread as they bake</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the
            cookies to cool 2 minutes on the baking sheets and then carefully flip the cookies over and transfer them,
            upside down, to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cookies are cooling, make the icing. In a large mixing bowl, combine the confectionersâ€™ sugar,
            boiling water, and vanilla. Mix well to get a spreadable icing. Add a little more water, if needed. Using an
            offset spatula, spread a thin layer of icing onto the flat side, the former bottom, of each cookie. Return
            the cookies to the wire rack to dry. You should have about 1/2 cup of icing left.</li>
        <li>While the white icing is drying, melt the chocolate chips in a microwave or double boiler. When the chips
            are all melted and smooth, whisk the melted chocolate into the remaining icing. The chocolate icing should
            be thicker than the white, but still be spreadable. If it is too thick, add a little hot water to thin it
            out. Use the offset spatula to frost one half of each cookie over the white icing. Return the cookies to the
            wire racks to dry. Store leftovers in a covered container for up for 5 days.</li>
